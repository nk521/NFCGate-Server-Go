NFCGate Server rewrite in GoLang

On relaying a NXP DESFire EV1 python version took me ~35s to do a full scan using NXP's TagInfo android app.
The GoLang version took ~16s to do the same.

However, GoLang version of NFCGate's server don't care about your session number. It also doesn't support
plugins.

==========

Building and running the server -

    make deps
    make
    make run # if you want to run the executable

==========

The workflow -
1. Run the server and define the host, port and log arguments
    make
    ./builds/nfcgate_server_go [-host <host>] [-port <port>] ([-log <filename.log>] | [-lograw <filename.gob>])

2. if you're logging raw bytes then you must run the following to get a log file
    python3 gobdecode.py <filename.gob>

==========

Future - 
1. (DONE) Ability for the server to emulate user defined frames to PICC/PCD during a session.
